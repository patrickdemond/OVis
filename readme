How to build ovis
=================

Ovis uses CMake (http://cmake.org/) to configure its build process.  CMake is operating system
independent, so in theory it should be possible to build this project under Linux, Windows or
Macintosh.  I stree the words "in theory" since it has currently only been tested and developed
under Linux.


Required Libraries
==================

Ovis uses the VTK library for visualization purposes, the Qt library for its user interface and
libxml2 for parsing Orlando data.  Furthermore it, along with VTK, is build using CMake.


libxml2 (xmlsoft.org)
---------------------
You will need to install libxml2.  This can be done by downloading pre-compiled binaries or
building from the source, both of which are available from the website.  Many linux package
managers also include this library in their repositories.


Qt4 (qt.nokia.com)
------------------
You will need the Qt4 development/framework libraries.  You can download these from the Qt
website or install them using your distro's package manager.  The complete SDK isn't necessary.


CMake (cmake.org)
-----------------
There are plenty of pre-compiled binaries of CMake available on the website, or you can download
the source and build it yourself.  Also, many linux distros have it build into their package
managers.  I recommend trying this option first since it's the quickest and easiest to do.


VTK (vtk.org)
-------------
You will need the build VTK from the source code which can be downloaded from their website.
VTK uses CMake to set up the build environment the same way that Ovis does:

1. Download the source code version 5.6.1 or later and unpack the source code

2. Create a build directory somewhere OUTSIDE of the VTK source code tree.  It's important to
   do this somewhere other than the source tree so that if things go wrong you can just nuke
   the build directory and start over without loosing any source files.

3. Inside your build directory, run cmake:

   For linux: cmake -g "Unix Makefiles" /path/to/VTK/source
   
   (If you want to build under a different operating system then just type cmake (without any
   arguments) to see a list of options along with (at the bottom) a list of "generators" which
   you can use in place of "Unix Makefiles" above.  Under windows it would be "Visual Studio" or
   "NMake" under windows, or "XCode" under Mac.

   If all goes well you should see cmake spit out a bunch of text but no errors.

4. You should now have a CMakeCache.txt file (along with a bunch of other stuff).  Open it
   with your favourite editor and set the following:

   CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:STRING=Release
   VTK_USE_INFOVIS:BOOL=ON
   VTK_USE_QT:BOOL=ON

5. Re-run cmake by typing "cmake ." in the build directory.  When it is done you should a message
   something like "Build files have been written to: ..."

6. You are now ready to build the VTK libraries by typing "make".  This should take anywhere from
   10 minutes to an hour or more, depending on the system.


Building ovis
=============

Once you've gone through the process of building VTK using CMake this will seem familiar.

1. You can download the latest version of ovis by cloning the git repository:

   git clone https://emondpd@www.sharcnet.ca/git/dp489
    
   Or if you're not familiar with git you can download the source from here:
   https://www.sharcnet.ca/git/?p=dp489;a=snapshot;h=HEAD;sf=tgz

   I believe you need a sharcnet account to access the source, so if neither work let me
   know and I'll email you the source or something like that.

2. Create a build directory somewhere OUTSIDE of the ovis source code tree (again, outside
   for the same reasons as I described in building VTK above).

3. Inside your build directory, run cmake:

   For linux: cmake -g "Unix Makefiles" /path/to/ovis/source

   Unlike when preparing VTK, this time you should see cmake spit out some errors.  That's
   fine, this is because cmake needs to know where you put VTK (and the other libraries if they
   were not installed in a standard place)

4. Ignore the errors for now and open the CMakeCache.txt file and change the following:

   CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:STRING=Release
   VTK_DIR:PATH=/path/to/VTK/build/directory/

5. Re-run cmake by typing "cmake ." in the build directory.  When it is done the error message
   should go away and you see "Build files have been written to: ..." once more.

6. You are now ready to build ovis by typing "make".
